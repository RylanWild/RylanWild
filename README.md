## Hi I'm Ruolan! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a second year Master student in the Embedded Systems program at KTH. Here are some details about me:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on an assignment related to sound localization.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about embedded AI and real-time operating systems(RTOS).
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on projects involving embedded AI in the region of Smart Healthcare or Smart Sports.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about Embedded Systems Programme at KTH! I'm currently the student ambassador of this programme.[Ask me questions](https://www.kth.se/en/studies/master/embedded-systems/students/ruolan-1.1350111)
- ðŸ“« You can reach me at my email: ruolanw@kth.se.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I have a comic account on Xiaohongshu and has 5000+ followers! [Check my comic account!](https://www.xiaohongshu.com/user/profile/5f4a35e5000000000101f5ee)
## Projects

- [Mini CPU Design and Verification]([https://github.com/RylanWild/Project1](https://github.com/RylanWild/KTH_Master_Courses_EmbeddedSystems/tree/main/IL2234_Digital_Systems_Design_and_Verification_using_Hardware_Description_Languages/Lab4)): Designed a three- stage pipeline CPU using SystemVerilog which includes RegisterFile, ROM, SRAM and ALU.It also includes a testbench to generate random instructions and check the timing or correctness.
- [Implementation of Image Procession Application]([https://github.com/RylanWild/Project2](https://github.com/RylanWild/KTH_Master_Courses_EmbeddedSystems/tree/main/IL2212_Embedded_Software)):Using the synchronous programming language Lustre and ForSyDe modelling environment, then use high-level synthesis tool to implement the SDF model in C and finally implement on a DE2 FPGA.
